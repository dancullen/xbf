"""
xbee.py re-implements the 'xbee' module from Digi XBee MicroPython in CPython using xbee-python library
and an XBee attached locally to a PC. Rationale: This allows MicroPython code written for an XBee to be
developed on a PC for convenience. Once the code is working, it can be deployed to the XBee for testing
with the actual Digi MicroPython interpreter.
